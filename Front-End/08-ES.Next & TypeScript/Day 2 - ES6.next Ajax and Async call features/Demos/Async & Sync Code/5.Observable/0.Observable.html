			/*
			The Observer is a design pattern where an object 
			(known as a subject) maintains a list of objects depending on it 
			(observers), automatically notifying them of any changes to state.

			When a subject needs to notify observers about something happening, 
			it broadcasts a notification to the observers.

			When we no longer need  a particular observer to be notified 
			of changes by the subject they are registered with, 
			the subject can remove them from the list of observers.

			**Difference between Observable and Promises?
			- Observable tell us when a piece of data has changed. 
			So you can add an Observable to a variable, 
			and it'll watch your variable for any changes that happen.

			- A Promise handles a single event when an async operation completes or fails.
			*Promises:
			- returns a single value
			- not cancellable
			*Observables:
			- works with multiple values over time
			- cancellable
			- supports map, filter, reduce and similar operators
