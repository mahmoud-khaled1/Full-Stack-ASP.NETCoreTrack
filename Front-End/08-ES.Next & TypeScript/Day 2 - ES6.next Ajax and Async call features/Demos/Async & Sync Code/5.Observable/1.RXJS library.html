			/*
			 RxJS, or ReactiveX, or reactive programming:
			 These are terms that are becoming more and more prominent when 
			 talking about the latest-and-greatest front-end technologies.

			 ReactiveX is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based 
			 programs by using observable sequences.
			 RxJS is the JavaScript version of ReactiveX library.
			*/

			/*Example:
			 The following is an Observable that pushes the values 1, 2, 3 
			 immediately (synchronously) when subscribed, and the 
			 value 4 after one second has passed since the subscribe call, 
			 then completes.

			 -- Subscribing to an Observable is analogous to calling a Function.
			 -- Observables can "return" multiple values over time, something which functions cannot.
			 -- Observables are able to deliver values either synchronously or asynchronously.
			 */
			//Create observable:
			//Observables can be created with create, but usually we use the so-called creation operators, like of, from, interval, etc.
			var myObservable = Rx.Observable.create(function (observer) {
				//Executing Observables
				//The code inside Observable.create(function subscribe(observer) {...}) 
				//represents an "Observable execution", 
				//a lazy computation that only happens for each Observer that subscribes. 
				//The execution produces multiple values over time, either synchronously or asynchronously.
				
				/*There are three types of values an Observable Execution can deliver:
				 - "Next" notification: sends a value such as a Number, a String, an Object, etc.
				 - "Error" notification: sends a JavaScript Error or exception.
				 - "Complete" notification: does not send a value.

				 In an Observable Execution, zero to infinite Next 
				 notifications may be delivered. 
				 If either an Error or Complete notification is delivered, 
				 then nothing else can be delivered afterwards.
				*/

				observer.next(1);
				observer.next(2);
				observer.next(3);
				setTimeout(() => {
					observer.next(4);
					observer.complete();
				}, 1000);
			});

			//Subscribe to observable:
			//Subscribing to an Observable is like calling a function, 
			//providing callbacks where the data will be delivered to.
			console.log('just before subscribe');
			myObservable.subscribe((x)=>console.log(x));
			console.log('just after subscribe');
