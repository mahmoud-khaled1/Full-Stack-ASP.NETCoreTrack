                Many actions in Javascript are asynchronous.
                One of the solution if you want some code to be executed 
                only after an async. func. is callback functions.

                A callback function is a function passed into another function 
                as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function 
                to complete some kind of routine or action.
                */
        //Example:
        setTimout(() => {
            console.log("Message after 3 seconds!");
        }, 3000);
        console.log("After setTomeout");

        //Example for callback function in JQuery.
        function getProduct() {
            var url = "https://reqres.in/api/products/1";
            //$.getJSON(url,callback_function);
            $.get(url, function(result) {
                console.log(result);
            });

            console.log("after ajax call");
        }

        //Examples in JQuery
        $(document).ready(function() {
            $("p").hide(5000, function() {
                console.log("Hide Completed...")
            });
            //console.log("Hide completed after hide function");
        });



        /*
			“Callback Hell” Problem And Solution:
			In asynchronous code execution, which is simply execution of 
			code in any order, sometimes it is common to have numerous levels 
			of callback functions to the extent that you have code that looks like 
			the following. The messy code below is called callback hell because of
			the difficulty of following the code due to the many callbacks. 
			
			Here are two solutions to this problem:
    		1-Name your functions and declare them and pass just the name of 
			the function as the callback, instead of defining an anonymous 
			function in the parameter of the main function.
    		2-Modularity: Separate your code into modules, so you can export 
			a section of code that does a particular job. 
			Then you can import that module into your larger application.
