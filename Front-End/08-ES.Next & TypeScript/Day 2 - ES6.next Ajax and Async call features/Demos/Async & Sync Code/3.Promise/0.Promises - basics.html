        /*
        The Promise object is used for asynchronous computations. 
        A Promise represents a value which may be available now, or in the future, or never.

        A Promise is a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. 
        It allows you to associate handlers with an asynchronous action's eventual success value or failure reason. 
        This lets asynchronous methods return values like synchronous methods: instead of immediately returning the final value, the asynchronous method returns a promise to supply the value at some point in the future.

        A Promise is in one of these states:

            pending: initial state, not fulfilled or rejected.
            fulfilled: meaning that the operation completed successfully.
            rejected: meaning that the operation failed.
        pending promise can either be fulfilled with a value, or rejected with a reason (error). When either of these options happen, the associated handlers queued up by a promise's then method are called. (If the promise has already been fulfilled or rejected when a corresponding handler is attached, the handler will be called, so there is no race condition between an asynchronous operation completing and its handlers being attached.)

        }

        function userFun() {
            console.log("I am the function that should run after setTimeOut");
        }
        // Call the function
        myFun();
        //I want this function to be executed after setTimeout Finished.

            //We call resolve(...) when what we were doing async succeeded, and reject(...) when it failed.
            //In this example, we use setTimeout(...) to simulate async code. 
            //In reality, you will probably be using something like XHR or an HTML5 API.

        /*
        	A promise object serves as a link between the producing code (executor)
        	 and the consuming functions – those that want to receive the result/error. Consuming functions can be registered using methods promise.then and promise.catch.

        	The syntax of .then is:
        	promise.then(
        		function(result) {  //handle a successful result  },
        		function(error) {  //handle an error  }
        	);
        */

        // after promise finish then ....
        myFirstPromise.then(function(successMessage) {
            //successMessage is whatever we passed in the resolve(...) function above.
            //It doesn't have to be a string, but if it is only a succeed message, it probably will be.
            console.log("I am the function that should run after setTimeOut! And it returned: " + successMessage);
        }, function(err) {
            console.log("I am the function that should run after setTimeOut! And error occured: " + err);
        });
        //Promises are asynchronous. The following console.log 
        //will be executed before promise
        console.log("Testing: promises are async. - this is after promise call");

        //OR//
        myFirstPromise.then(function(successMessage) {
                //successMessage is whatever we passed in the resolve(...) function above.
                //It doesn't have to be a string, but if it is only a succeed message, it probably will be.
                console.log("I am the function that should run after setTimeOut! And it returned: " + successMessage);

        //----------------------------------------------------------//
        //Example using Arrow function
        var wait1000 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            setTimeout(resolve, 2000)
        }).then(() => {
            console.log('Yay!')
        });

        /*wait1000.then(()=> {
			  console.log('Yay!')
			});8/

			//--------------------------------------------------//
			//handling resolve, reject by arrow functions

			let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
				setTimeout(() => resolve("done!"), 1000);
			});

			// resolve runs the first function in .then
			promise.then(
				result => console.log(result), // shows "done!" after 1 second
				error => console.log(error) // doesn't run
				//the same as
				//(result) => console.log(result), // shows "done!" after 1 second
				//(error) => console.log(error) // doesn't run
			);

			//If we’re interested only in errors, then we can use 
			//.then(null, function) or an “alias” to it: .catch(function)
			let promise2 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
				setTimeout(() => reject(new Error("Whoops!")), 1000);
			});

			// .catch(f) is the same as promise.then(null, f)
			promise2.catch(err=>console.log(err.message)); // shows "Error: Whoops!" after 1 second
