Node package manager (npm) is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language maintained by npm,
used  for install and uninstall and update  any library or package in our application .

--------
webpack :The motivations behind webpack is to gather all your dependencies, which includes
not just code, but other assets as well, and generate a dependency graph. Bundlers are only 
prepared to handle JS files, so webpack needs to preprocess all the other files 
and assets before they get bundled
so the main responsibility of webpack is gathering all JS files in one file and all CSS files in one file and so on ..
and generate a dependency graph
-------
- some important commands :-
1-npm -init  ----> this command for initalize the app and create package for the app 
2-npm i jquery ----> for install anything such as jquery we do this command 
3-npm i webpack webpack-cli --save-div ---> for install webpack in our app
 after install it we should create file ->(webpack.config.js ) and init all thing 
then write this command --> npm run build  ,after that will create folder named dist and have 
file named bundle.js contain all our js files with all their functions
